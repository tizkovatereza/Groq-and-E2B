# Code Interpreting with Groq and E2B

Learn how to use E2B with LLMs powered by Groq to securely run the AI-generated code.

## What is E2B?

E2B is the secure code execution layer for the AI app.

The ability to execute the code as opposed to only generate it has many advantages:

- Better reasoning
- More complex tasks (e.g., advanced data analysis or mathematics)
- Producing tangible results such as charts
- Immediate testing (and correcting) of the produced output.


The open-source [Code Interpreter SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/code-interpreter) by [E2B](https://e2b.dev/docs) provides a long-running secure sandboxed environment where you can run the output generated by Groq's LLMs. This SDK is tailor-made for AI data analysts, coding apps, and reasoning-heavy agents.

The SDK quickly creates a secure cloud sandbox. Inside the sandbox is a running Jupyter server which the LLM can use.


## AI data analyst with E2B Code Interpreter SDK

### 1. Prerequisites

Create an `index.ts` file for the main program, copy the `env.template` file, and save it to a `.gitignore` file.

Get the E2B API key [here](https://e2b.dev/docs/getting-started/api-key) and the Groq API key [here](https://api.Groq.xyz/settings/api-keys).

Download the CSV file from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishanthsalian/socioeconomic-country-profiles/code) and upload it to the same directory as your program. Rename it to `data.csv`.


### 2. Install the SDKs

```sh
npm install @e2b/code-interpreter@0.0.5 groq-sdk@0.5.0 dotenv@16.4.5
```

### 3. Set up the API keys and model instructions.
In this step you upload your E2B and Groq API keys to the program. In the JS & TS case, the API keys are stored in the `.env` file,
You pick the model of your choice by uncommenting it. There are some recommended models that are great at code generation, but you can add a different one from [here](https://api.Groq.ai/models).

The model is assigned a data scientist role and explained the uploaded CSV. You can choose different data but need to update the instructions accordingly.

```js
import { CodeInterpreter, Result, ProcessMessage } from '@e2b/code-interpreter'
import { Groq } from 'groq-sdk'
import fs from 'node:fs'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config()

// Define API keys

// TODO: Get your Groq AI API key from https://console.groq.com/
const GROQ_API_KEY = process.env.GROQ_API_KEY

// TODO: Get your E2B API key from https://e2b.dev/docs
const E2B_API_KEY = process.env.E2B_API_KEY

// Choose the model

const MODEL_NAME = 'llama-3.1-70b-versatile'
// const MODEL_NAME = 'llama-3.1-8b-instant'
// const MODEL_NAME = 'llama3-groq-70b-8192-tool-use-preview'
// const MODEL_NAME = 'llama3-groq-8b-8192-tool-use-preview'
// const MODEL_NAME = 'llama3-70b-8192'
// const MODEL_NAME = 'gemma2-9b-it'

// Provide system prompt
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You're a python data scientist. You are given tasks to complete and you run Python code to solve them.

Generally, you follow these rules:
- ALWAYS FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE IN MARKDOWN
- ALWAYS RESPOND ONLY WITH CODE IN CODE BLOCK LIKE THIS:
\`\`\`python
{code}
\`\`\`
- the Python code runs in jupyter notebook.
- every time you generate Python, the code is executed in a separate cell. it's okay to make multiple calls to \`execute_python\`.
- display visualizations using matplotlib or any other visualization library directly in the notebook. don't worry about saving the visualizations to a file.
- you have access to the internet and can make api requests.
- you also have access to the filesystem and can read/write files.
- you can install any pip package (if it exists) if you need to be running \`!pip install {package}\`. The usual packages for data analysis are already preinstalled though.
- you can run any Python code you want, everything is running in a secure sandbox environment

```

### 4. Add code interpreting capabilities and initialize the model

Now we define the function that will use the code interpreter by E2B. Every time the LLM assistant decides that it needs to execute code, this function will be used. Read more about the Code Interpreter SDK [here](https://e2b.dev/docs/code-interpreter/installation).
We also initialize the Groq client. The function for matching code blocks is important because we need to pick the right part of the output that contains the code produced by the LLM. The chat function takes care of the interaction with the LLM. It calls the E2B code interpreter anytime there is a code to be run.

```js
const client = new Groq({ apiKey: GROQ_API_KEY })

async function codeInterpret(codeInterpreter: CodeInterpreter, code: string): Promise<Result[]> {
  console.log('Running code interpreter...')

  const exec = await codeInterpreter.notebook.execCell(code, {
      onStderr: (msg: ProcessMessage) => console.log('[Code Interpreter stderr]', msg),
      onStdout: (stdout: ProcessMessage) => console.log('[Code Interpreter stdout]', stdout)
  })

  if (exec.error) {
      console.error('[Code Interpreter ERROR]', exec.error)
      throw new Error(exec.error.value)
  }

  return exec.results
}


async function chat(codeInterpreter: CodeInterpreter, userMessage: string): Promise<Result[]> {
  console.log(`\n${'='.repeat(50)}\nUser Message: ${userMessage}\n${'='.repeat(50)}`)

  const messages = [
      { role: 'system', content: SYSTEM_PROMPT },
      { role: 'user', content: userMessage }
  ]

  try {
        const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
        model: MODEL_NAME,
        messages,
        // tools,
        max_tokens: 4096,
       })

      const responseMessage = response.choices[0].message.content
      const codeBlockMatch = responseMessage ? responseMessage.match(/```python\n([\s\S]*?)\n```/) : null;

      if (codeBlockMatch && codeBlockMatch[1]) {
          const pythonCode = codeBlockMatch[1]
          console.log('CODE TO RUN')
          console.log(pythonCode)
          const codeInterpreterResults = await codeInterpret(codeInterpreter, pythonCode)
          return codeInterpreterResults
      } else {
          console.error('Failed to match any Python code in model\'s response')
          return []
      }
  } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error during API call:', error)
      throw error
  }
}
```

### 5. Upload the dataset

The CSV data is uploaded programmatically, not via AI-generated code. The code interpreter by E2B runs inside the E2B sandbox. Read more about the file upload [here](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/api/upload).

```js
async function uploadDataset(codeInterpreter: CodeInterpreter): Promise<string> {
  console.log('Uploading dataset to Code Interpreter sandbox...')
  const datasetPath = './data.csv'

  if (!fs.existsSync(datasetPath)) {
      throw new Error('Dataset file not found')
  }

  const fileBuffer = fs.readFileSync(datasetPath)

  try {
      const remotePath = await codeInterpreter.uploadFile(fileBuffer, 'data.csv')
      if (!remotePath) {
          throw new Error('Failed to upload dataset')
      }
      console.log('Uploaded at', remotePath)
      return remotePath
  } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error during file upload:', error)
      throw error
  }
}
```

### 6. Put everything together

Finally, we put everything together and let the AI assistant upload the data, run an analysis, and generate a PNG file with a chart. 
You can update the task for the assistant in this step. If you decide to change the CSV file you are using, don't forget to update the prompt too.


```js
async function run() {
  const codeInterpreter = await CodeInterpreter.create({apiKey: E2B_API_KEY})

  try {
      const remotePath = await uploadDataset(codeInterpreter)
      console.log('Remote path of the uploaded dataset:', remotePath)

      const codeInterpreterResults = await chat(
          codeInterpreter,
          // Task for the model
          'Make a chart showing linear regression of the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy from the data. Filter out any missing values or values in wrong format.'
      )
      console.log('codeInterpreterResults:', codeInterpreterResults)

      const result = codeInterpreterResults[0]
      console.log('Result object:', result)

      if (result && result.png) {
          fs.writeFileSync('image_1.png', Buffer.from(result.png, 'base64'))
          console.log('Success: Image generated and saved as image_1.png')
      } else {
          console.error('Error: No PNG data available.')
      }

  } catch (error) {
      console.error('An error occurred:', error)
  } finally {
      await codeInterpreter.close()
  }
}

run()
```

### 7. Run the program and see the results

The resulting chart is saved to the same directory as a PNG file. The plot shows the linear regression of the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy from the CSV data.
